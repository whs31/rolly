   * @brief GSL-like owning raw pointer typedef.

   * directly with raw pointers that own memory.
   *
   * Ideally such code should be restricted to the implementation of low-level abstractions.
   * <code>rolly::owner<T></code> can also be used as a stepping point in converting legacy code
   * to use more modern RAII constructs, such as smart pointers.
   * @tparam T Pointer type.
